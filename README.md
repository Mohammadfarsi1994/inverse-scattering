The code is implemented based on "Polarization-Dependent Loss: New Definition and Measurement Techniques, 2015" by NO ́E et al." 

- The algorithm is susceptible to channel estimation noise
- We have proposed a learning-based approach that has a higher tolerance to estimation noise see ("M. Farsi, C.Häger, M. Karlsson, E. Agrell, "Learning to Extract Distributed Polarization Sensing Data from Noisy Jones Matrices")
- The algorithm experiences numerical instability when the number of segments increases (N>10)

Please see the notebook for more information.
